I can ensure that my software is functional and secure through thorough testing. Testing should include functional, non-functional, static, and dynamic testing. Additionally, functionality can be obtained through meeting criteria and requirements. Interpreting user needs are important in software development. I interpret needs by understanding user requirements then planning a method to incorporating said requirements into the software. It's beneficial to try and get a basic understanding of requirements initially then constructing a flowchart or diagram to model the ideas and features required. I approach software development by fully understanding requirements then creating an outline of these requirements to guide my coding. Then, when I believe my software functions as required and after much debugging, I will run additional unit tests to ensure all blocks of code function properly. Ultimately, creating a secure, quality program is a benchmark of software development.
